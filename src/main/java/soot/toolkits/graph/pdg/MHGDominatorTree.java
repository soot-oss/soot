/**
 * Constructs a multi-headed dominator tree. This is mostly the same as the DominatorTree but the buildTree method is changed
 * to allow multiple heads. This can be used for graphs that are multi-headed and cannot be augmented to become
 * single-headed.
 *
 * March 2014: Pulled this code into the original {@link DominatorTree}. This class now became a stub (Steven Arzt).
