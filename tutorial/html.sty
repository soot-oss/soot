% LaTeX2HTML Version 96.2 : html.sty
% 
% This file contains definitions of LaTeX commands which are
% processed in a special way by the translator. 
% For example, there are commands for embedding external hypertext links,
% for cross-references between documents or for including raw HTML.
% This file includes the comments.sty file v2.0 by Victor Eijkhout
% In most cases these commands do nothing when processed by LaTeX.
%
% Place this file in a directory accessible to LaTeX (i.e., somewhere
% in the TEXINPUTS path.)
%
% NOTE: This file works with LaTeX 2.09 or (the newer) LaTeX2e.
%       If you only have LaTeX 2.09, some complex LaTeX2HTML features
%       like support for segmented documents are not available.

% Changes:
% See the change log at end of file.

\providecommand{\latextohtml}{\LaTeX2\texttt{HTML}}


%%% LINKS TO EXTERNAL DOCUMENTS
%
% This can be used to provide links to arbitrary documents.
% The first argumment should be the text that is going to be
% highlighted and the second argument a URL.
% The hyperlink will appear as a hyperlink in the HTML 
% document and as a footnote in the dvi or ps files.
%
\newcommand{\htmladdnormallinkfoot}[2]{#1\footnote{#2}} 


% This is an alternative definition of the command above which
% will ignore the URL in the dvi or ps files.
\newcommand{\htmladdnormallink}[2]{#1}


% This command takes as argument a URL pointing to an image.
% The image will be embedded in the HTML document but will
% be ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\htmladdimg}[1]{}


%%% CROSS-REFERENCES BETWEEN (LOCAL OR REMOTE) DOCUMENTS
%
% This can be used to refer to symbolic labels in other Latex 
% documents that have already been processed by the translator.
% The arguments should be:
% #1 : the URL to the directory containing the external document
% #2 : the path to the labels.pl file of the external document.
% If the external document lives on a remote machine then labels.pl 
% must be copied on the local machine.
%
%e.g. \externallabels{http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/WWW/doc/tex2html/latex2html}
%                    {/usr/cblelca/nikos/tmp/labels.pl}
% The arguments are ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\externallabels}[2]{}


% This complements the \externallabels command above. The argument
% should be a label defined in another latex document and will be
% ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\externalref}[1]{}


% Suggested by  Uffe Engberg (http://www.brics.dk/~engberg/)
% This allows the same effect for citations in external bibliographies.
% An  \externallabels  command must be given, locating a labels.pl file
% which defines the location and keys used in the external .html file.
%  
\newcommand{\externalcite}{\nocite}


%%% HTMLRULE
% This command adds a horizontal rule and is valid even within
% a figure caption.
% Here we introduce a stub for compatibility.
\newcommand{\htmlrule}{\protect\HTMLrule}
\newcommand{\HTMLrule}{\@ifstar\htmlrulestar\htmlrulestar}
\newcommand{\htmlrulestar}[1]{}

% This command adds information within the <BODY> ... </BODY> tag
%
\newcommand{\bodytext}[1]{}
\newcommand{\htmlbody}{}


%%% HYPERREF 
% Suggested by Eric M. Carol <eric@ca.utoronto.utcc.enfm>
% Similar to \ref but accepts conditional text. 
% The first argument is HTML text which will become ``hyperized''
% (underlined).
% The second and third arguments are text which will appear only in the paper
% version (DVI file), enclosing the fourth argument which is a reference to a label.
%
%e.g. \hyperref{using the tracer}{using the tracer (see Section}{)}{trace}
% where there is a corresponding \label{trace}

%%% HYPERCITE --- added by RRM
% Suggested by Stephen Simpson <simpson@math.psu.edu>
% effects the same ideas as in  \hyperref, but for citations.
% It does not allow an optional argument to the \cite, in LaTeX.
%
%   \hypercite{<html-text>}{<LaTeX-text>}{<opt-text>}{<key>}
%
% uses the pre/post-texts in LaTeX, with a  \cite{<key>}
%
%   \hypercite[ext]{<html-text>}{<LaTeX-text>}{<key>}

%%% HTMLREF
% Reference in HTML version only.
% Mix between \htmladdnormallink and \hyperref.
% First arg is text for in both versions, second is label for use in HTML
% version.
\newcommand{\htmlref}[2]{#1}

%%% HTMLCITE
% Reference in HTML version only.
% Mix between \htmladdnormallink and \hypercite.
% First arg is text for in both versions, second is citation for use in HTML
% version.
\newcommand{\htmlcite}[2]{#1}


%%% HTMLIMAGE
% This command can be used inside any environment that is converted
% into an inlined image (eg a "figure" environment) in order to change
% the way the image will be translated. The argument of \htmlimage
% is really a string of options separated by commas ie 
% [scale=<scale factor>],[external],[thumbnail=<reduction factor>
% The scale option allows control over the size of the final image.
% The ``external'' option will cause the image not to be inlined 
% (images are inlined by default). External images will be accessible
% via a hypertext link. 
% The ``thumbnail'' option will cause a small inlined image to be 
% placed in the caption. The size of the thumbnail depends on the
% reduction factor. The use of the ``thumbnail'' option implies
% the ``external'' option.
%
% Example:
% \htmlimage{scale=1.5,external,thumbnail=0.2}
% will cause a small thumbnail image 1/5th of the original size to be
% placed in the final document, pointing to an external image 1.5
% times bigger than the original.
% 
\newcommand{\htmlimage}[1]{}


% \htmlborder causes a border to be placed around an image or table
% when the image is placed within a <TABLE> cell.
\newcommand{\htmlborder}[1]{}

% Put \begin{makeimage}, \end{makeimage} around LaTeX to ensure its
% translation into an image.
% This shields sensitive text from being translated.
\newenvironment{makeimage}{}{}


% A dummy environment that can be useful to alter the order
% in which commands are processed, in LaTeX2HTML
\newenvironment{tex2html_deferred}{}{}


%%% HTMLADDTONAVIGATION
% This command appends its argument to the buttons in the navigation
% panel. It is ignored by LaTeX.
%
% Example:
% \htmladdtonavigation{\htmladdnormallink
%              {\htmladdimg{http://server/path/to/gif}}
%              {http://server/path}}

% Comment.sty   version 2.0, 19 June 1992
% selectively in/exclude pieces of text: the user can define new
% comment versions, and each is controlled separately.
% This style can be used with plain TeX or LaTeX, and probably
% most other packages too.
%
% Examples of use in LaTeX and TeX follow \endinput

%
%    eijkhout@cs.utk.edu
%
% Usage: all text included in between
%    \comment ... \endcomment
% or \begin{comment} ... \end{comment}
% is discarded. The closing command should appear on a line
% of its own. No starting spaces, nothing after it.
% This environment should work with arbitrary amounts
% of comment.
%
% Other 'comment' environments are defined by
% and are selected/deselected with
% \includecomment{versiona}
% \excludecoment{versionb}
%
% These environments are used as
% \versiona ... \endversiona
% or \begin{versiona} ... \end{versiona}
% with the closing command again on a line of its own.
%
% Basic approach:
% to comment something out, scoop up  every line in verbatim mode
% as macro argument, then throw it away.
% For inclusions, both the opening and closing comands
% are defined as noop
%
% Changed \next to \html@next to prevent clashes with other sty files
% (mike@emn.fr)
% Changed \html@next to \htmlnext so the \makeatletter and
% \makeatother commands could be removed (they were causing other
% style files - changebar.sty - to crash) (nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk)
% Changed \htmlnext back to \html@next...

%  Define the \segment[align]{file}{section-command}{section-title} command,
%  and its helper macros.  This command does four things:
%       1)  Begins a new LaTeX section;
%       2)  Writes a list of section counters to file.ptr, each
%           of which represents the sum of the LaTeX section
%           counters, and the l-counters, defined above;
%       3)  Write an \htmlhead{section-title} command to file.ptr;
%       4)  Inputs file.tex.
